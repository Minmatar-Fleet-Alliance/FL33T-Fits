# Keres

Advanced EWAR Frigate


## Description

Utilizes Remote Sensor Dampeners (Damps) to disrupt hostile DPS or Logistics. This ship is entirely reliant on range to avoid incoming DPS so do not burn close unless absolutely necessary.

Targeting Range - Use on long range platforms like enemy ECM or ships with long engagement ranges.
Scan Resolution - Use on Logistics ships that are close to the enemy fleet or against any ship that is too close for targeting range to make a difference.

Small gang refit should replace the meta Dampener for the T2 Warp Disruptor and remove the cloak.
