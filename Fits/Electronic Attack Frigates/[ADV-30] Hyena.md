# Hyena

Advanced EWAR Frigate

## Description

Utilizes Target Painters to enhance the friendly fleet's DPS against a hostile target. This ship is entirely reliant on range to avoid incoming DPS so do not burn close unless absolutely necessary. Use 3x TP if purely fleet support, mix in webs if it's going to be possible to get close enough to apply them.
