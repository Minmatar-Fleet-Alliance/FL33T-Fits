# Devoter

Armor Heavy Interdictor

## Description

Heavy armor support cruiser. Focus on locking down hostile Command Destroyers and securing tackle on primaries. 100km+ lock range allows you to negate spearfishing as well by locking them and spamming your warp disruption field generator on them with a script loaded. Try to isolate the second boosh that gets activated since that's the one you want to target, but in a pinch it's a 50/50 shot. 

Important: Warp disruption scripts will shut down a hostile boosher's microjumpdrive, and these are very long range.
