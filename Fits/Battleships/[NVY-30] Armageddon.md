# Armageddon

Energy Neutralizer Support Battleship

## Description

This fit is designed to prevent enemy ships from getting too comfortable within a 30km bubble of the primary Heavy Armor fleet. Neutralizers should focus on the enemy anchor and logistics if possible, or any DPS whose guns use capacitor if not. Grappler is extra support if they get very close. 500mn refit in cargo, swap 2 T2 neuts for the scoped ones and then switch the AB to MWD. Default SEBO to ECCM.
