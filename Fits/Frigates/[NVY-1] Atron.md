# Atron

Solo Atron fit


## Description

An anti-kiting fit for the Atron, designed for catching typical kiters such as the Tristan or the Slicer and burning them close with blasters. The Atron is the fastest hull amongst T1 frigates and as such can fairly easily catch other MWD frigates and scram them upclose. Then its good DPS combined with a Afterburner for mitigation will seal the deal.
