# Retribution

Small gang cheap Retribution fit 


## Description

A meta fit for the small gang Retri, purposefully kept as cheap and lax on SP as possible to ease
people into flying small AF gangs. Designed to fit in our smallgang comp of Retri/Male/Keres/Thalia.
Meta point requires some heat to hold targets but it can shoot to its lock range with Aurora.
