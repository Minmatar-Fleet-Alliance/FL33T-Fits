# Osprey

High Damage/Mobility Fleet Logi


## Description

LARSB is the primary repping power of this fit so be sure to reload when able, emphasis on burst tank in the fleet over sustaining on grid since the damage output is so high and it's still a T1 resist profile. Capchain allows for hardener stability while moving at full MWD speeds for extended periods of time.
