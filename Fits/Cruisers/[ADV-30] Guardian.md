# Guardian

 Heavy Armor logistics cruiser

## Description

The step-up from the Augoror: the Guardian. Pretty much the best logistic cruiser in the game,
it sig tanks for days, rep like a truck from long distance. This is the rolls royce of
armor logi (until you step into a Nestor) and deserves excellent support skills and
Logistic Cruiser V in the long run. Load ECCM script by default.
