# Exequror

Fast/Cheap Armor Logistics

## Description

An Exequror designed for the logi wing of our long range ENI fleet, tank is on the lighter side cause
these should never be too close from the line of fire. Instead we favoured speed to let them keep up
with the ENIs. If your capacitor skills are low buy/use a Standard Mindflood.
