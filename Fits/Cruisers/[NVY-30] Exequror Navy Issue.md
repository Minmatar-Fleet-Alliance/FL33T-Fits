# Exequror Navy Issue 
Specialty armor cruiser

## Description
An advanced armor cruiser with a special purpose: sniping long range targets. It is very important for this ship to be (or to burn) away from the primary fight, and apply Javelin DPS at range, or snipe targets with Spike. 

Most fleets will not need more than a handful of these cruisers.
